# How to: Lexicography

## Dictionary

The platform provides a simple and intuitive interface for viewing and editing your dictionaries and allows you to export your dictionaries to a variety of formats.
In the future, we plan to integrate dictionaries into the annotation process and provide more advanced functionality for your dictionaries and annotation projects. This includes automatic generation of dictionaries and suitable usages and tasks.

Check out the [How to: Dictionary](/guide/how-to-dictionary) guide to learn how to use the dictionary interface.
